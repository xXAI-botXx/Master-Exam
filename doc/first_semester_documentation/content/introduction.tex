	% TO DO: 
	%     - Fill the gaps
	
	
	\section{High-Level Project}
	\label{sec:intro-high_project}
		- drilling (whats the problem)
		- reinforcement / generative model (the solution)
		- dataset
		- (round about) reached goals + open problems -> reflections / diffraction
	
	\section{Problem State}
	\label{sec:intro-problem}
		- complex physic relations do not learned
		- also do not heavily impact the loss (ai have not much motivation to learn it)
		
	\section{Goal}
	\label{sec:intro-goal}
		- test residual learning (splitted tasks / complex focus only)
			- test input abstraction
			- make a model with different subtasks
		- test sampling masks -> to focus more / only on the difficult part
