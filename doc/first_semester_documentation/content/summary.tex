	\label{sec:sum-reached}
		It is still questionable why generative models are challenged by learning complex distributions as such from complex physical tasks. The results from the here applied experiments hint that the problem comes from the complexity of the distribution and that separating the distribution in smaller distributions (residual learning) can help learning the complex distribution but this comes also with a more complex loss.
